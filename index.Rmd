# <small>Who am I?</small>

----

My name is Matthias Weiler

----

I am a psychologist

----

I am a psychotherapist

----

I work as a research assistant <br>at Freie Universität Berlin

----

I am a nerd

----

I like free software

----

I like open science



# <small>And who are you?</small>

----

Please raise your hand ...

----

... if you study psychology

----

... if you want to become a psychotherapist

----

... if you want to become a scientist

----

... if you have participated in <br>a (small) research project

----

... if you know what open science is

----

... if you are (a little) anxious <br>to speak English in class



# <small>What are we going to do here?</small>

----

In the course of this semester you will...

----

... learn what open science is

----

... get to know tools that help <br>you with your research

----

... plan and conduct a small research project

----

... present your results to others



# <small>Any questions so far?</small>



# <small>Today:<br>Introduction to digital open science</small>



# <small>Science - how does it work?</small>

The hypothetico-deductive model (Munafo et al. 2017)  
![The hypothetico-deductive model](img/s41562-016-0021-f1_edited.jpg)  
<small>Source (edited): https://media.nature.com/lw926/nature-assets/nathumbehav/2017/s41562-016-0021/images_hires/s41562-016-0021-f1.jpg</small>

What could possibly go wrong?



# <small>Quiz</small>

----

Which of the following articles <br>was actually published?

----

*A) Chocolate causes weight loss*  
or  
*B) Chocolate does not help you lose weight*

----

## <small>And the winner is ...</small>

*A) Chocolate causes weight loss*

----

<a href="https://de.scribd.com/doc/266969860/Chocolate-causes-weight-loss">... except it doesn't</a>



# <small>Question</small>

----

Why did it get published anyway?

----

## <small>Answer</small>

Because positive and novel studies are <br>
more likely to be published whereas <br>
negative studies and replications usually<br>
remain inside the scientists’ drawers

----

This is known as *publication bias* and  
can lead to "interesting" situations



# <small>The case of Bem</small>

----

*There is no cost to getting things wrong*  
*The cost is not getting them published*  
  
Prof. Brian Nosek

----

*Feeling the future: Experimental evidence <br>*
*for anomalous retroactive influences on <br>*
*cognition and affect* (Bem, 2011)

----

## <small>Please raise your hand...</small>
... if you believe that your <br>
current thoughts and feelings <br>
are influenced by future events

----

Precognition conflicts with what we <br>
know to be true about the world  

----

Still, researchers failing to reproduce Bem's <br>
findings had substantial problems getting <br>
their negative results published

----

Rather ironically, some of Bem's findings <br>
are the result of HARKing, which stands for <br>
"Hypothesizing After the Results are Known"

## <small>Scientists have a need for significance</small>

The process described here is known  
as *p-hacking* or <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dredging">*data dredging* </a>which <br>is the art of getting significant results

# <small>Other issues</small>

----

## <small>Failure to control for bias</small>

- Humans are prone to <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_cognitive_biases">cognitive biases</a>
- Scientists are humans
- Scientists are prone to cognitive biases (too)

----

## <small>Poor quality control</small>

- <a href = "http://andrewgelman.com/2015/04/28/whats-important-thing-statistics-thats-not-textbooks/">"Bad things happen when we don’t <br>think seriously about measurement"</a>
- Sloppy measurement often leads <br>to "noisy data"
- Noisy data leads to low statistical power

----

## <small>Low statistical power</small>

- $\alpha$: The conditional probability of incorrectly <br>
  rejecting H0 when it actually is true.
- $\beta$: The conditional probability of failing <br>
  to reject H0 when it is false.
- Power: The complement of β (i.e. 1 - β), this is the <br>
  probability of correctly rejecting H0 when it is false.
