# <small>Who am I?</small>

----

My name is Matthias Weiler

----

I am a psychologist

----

I am a psychotherapist

----

I work as a research assistant <br>at Freie Universität Berlin

----

I am a nerd

----

I like free software

----

I like open science



# <small>And who are you?</small>

----

Please raise your hand ...

----

... if you study psychology

----

... if you want to become a psychotherapist

----

... if you want to become a scientist

----

... if you have participated in <br>a (small) research project

----

... if you know what open science is

----

... if you are (a little) anxious <br>to speak English in class



# <small>What are we going to do here?</small>

----

In the course of this semester you will...

----

... learn what open science is

----

... get to know tools that help <br>you with your research

----

... plan and conduct a small research project

----

... present your results to others



# <small>Any questions so far?</small>



# <small>Today:<br>Why would I care for open science?</small>



# <small>Science - how does it work?</small>

The hypothetico-deductive model (Munafo et al. 2017)

What could possibly go wrong?



# <small>Quiz</small>

----

Which of the following articles <br>was actually published?

----

*A) Chocolate causes weight loss*  
or  
*B) Chocolate does not help you lose weight*

----

## <small>And the winner is ...</small>

<a href="https://de.scribd.com/doc/266969860/Chocolate-causes-weight-loss">*A) Chocolate causes weight loss*</a>

----

<a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/i-fooled-millions-into-thinking-chocolate-helps-weight-1707251800">... except it doesn't</a>



# <small>Question</small>

----

Why did it get published anyway?

----

## <small>Answer</small>

Because positive and novel studies are <br>
more likely to be published whereas <br>
negative studies and replications usually<br>
remain inside the scientists’ drawers

----

This is known as *publication bias*

----

*There is no cost to getting things wrong*  
*The cost is not getting them published*  
  
Prof. Brian Nosek



# <small>Feeling the future</small>

----

## <small>Please raise your hand...</small>
... if you believe that your <br>
current thoughts and feelings <br>
are influenced by future events

----

*Feeling the future: Experimental evidence <br>*
*for anomalous retroactive influences on <br>*
*cognition and affect* (Bem, 2011)

----

Precognition conflicts with what we <br>
know to be true about the world  

----

Still, researchers failing to reproduce Bem's <br>
findings had substantial problems getting <br>
their negative results published

----

Rather ironically, some of Bem's findings <br>
are the result of HARKing, which stands for <br>
"Hypothesizing After the Results are Known"



# <small>Exercises</small>

----

Please pair up with the  
person sitting next to you

----

## <small>Exercise 1</small>

----

Person 1: Please think of a  
number between 1 and 100

----

Person 2: Guess person 1's number

----

Person 1: Please tell person 2  
the number you thought of

----

Who of you made the right guess?

----

## <small>Exercise 2</small>

----

Person 1: Please think of a  
number between 1 and 100

----

Person 1: Please tell person 2  
the number you thought of

----

Person 2: Guess person 1's number

----

Who of you made the right guess?

----

This is how HARKing works

----

Except, instead of guessing a number you  
would try to answer a research question

## <small>Statistical power in a nutshell</small>

- $\alpha$: The conditional probability of incorrectly <br>
  rejecting H0 when it actually is true.
- $\beta$: The conditional probability of failing <br>
  to reject H0 when it is false.
- Power: The complement of β (i.e. 1 - β), this is the <br>
  probability of correctly rejecting H0 when it is false.

## <small>Better science with quality control</small>

- <a href = "http://andrewgelman.com/2015/04/28/whats-important-thing-statistics-thats-not-textbooks/">"Bad things happen when we don’t <br>think seriously about measurement"</a>
- Sloppy measurement often leads <br>to "noisy data"
- Noisy data leads to low statistical power
